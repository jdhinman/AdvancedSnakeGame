## Build Fixes History

### Fix #10: Kotlin Variable Scope Error in Compose Canvas
**Date:** 2025-01-05 23:55 UTC  
**Commit:** 5599869  

**Error:**
```
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
e: file:///home/builder/clone/app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt:207:9 Unresolved reference: settings
e: file:///home/builder/clone/app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt:228:61 Unresolved reference: settings
e: file:///home/builder/clone/app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt:229:61 Unresolved reference: settings
```

**Root Cause:**  
**Variable Scope Issue in Compose Canvas** - When implementing settings integration for game visuals, I referenced `settings` parameter inside the Canvas drawing scope where it wasn't accessible. In Jetpack Compose, Canvas content is executed in a DrawScope, which has limited access to variables from the enclosing Composable scope.

**Technical Details:**
- **Canvas DrawScope Isolation**: Canvas drawing operations run in a restricted scope
- **Variable Capture**: Compose Canvas can't directly access all function parameters
- **Compilation Stage**: Kotlin compiler couldn't resolve `settings` references in DrawScope context

**Solution:**  
**Extract Variables Before Canvas Block** - Pre-calculate needed values in Composable scope:

**GameScreen.kt changes:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Trying to access settings inside Canvas (fails)
Canvas(modifier = modifier) {
    if (settings.showGrid) { ... }  // ❌ Unresolved reference
    val bodyColor = Color(parseColor(settings.snakeTheme.bodyColorHex))  // ❌ Error
}

// AFTER: Extract values before Canvas (works)
val showGrid = settings.showGrid
val bodyColor = Color(android.graphics.Color.parseColor(settings.snakeTheme.bodyColorHex))
val headColor = Color(android.graphics.Color.parseColor(settings.snakeTheme.headColorHex))

Canvas(modifier = modifier) {
    if (showGrid) { ... }  // ✅ Works
    // Use bodyColor and headColor variables
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt` (lines 132-135, 212, 232-234)

**Technical Pattern:**
- **Variable Extraction**: Pre-compute values that Canvas needs from external scope
- **Scope Separation**: Keep Canvas drawing logic isolated from external parameters
- **Performance Benefit**: Avoids repeated property access during drawing operations

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Pre-extract Canvas Variables**: Always extract needed values before Canvas block
2. **Scope Awareness**: Remember Canvas DrawScope has limited variable access
3. **Compose Patterns**: Follow Compose best practices for Canvas integration
4. **Testing**: Test compilation locally before pushing complex Canvas changes

**Compose-Specific Notes:**
- Canvas DrawScope is optimized for drawing performance with restricted access
- State and parameter access should happen in Composable scope, not DrawScope
- Extract complex calculations before Canvas to improve performance
- This pattern is common when integrating settings/themes with Canvas drawing

**Related Fix:** This issue was introduced while implementing Fix #2 (snake theme rendering) and Fix #3 (grid display setting), demonstrating the importance of understanding Compose scope limitations.

**Cache Issue Update:** This fix suffered from persistent Codemagic cache (similar to Fix #9). Despite being correctly implemented and pushed to remote repository, Codemagic continued building the old cached version. Required cache-busting variable renames in commit e509f9c: `showGrid → isGridVisible`, `bodyColor → snakeBodyColor`, `headColor → snakeHeadColor`.

---

### Fix #9: Gradle Build Cache Invalidation - Force Recompilation
**Date:** 2025-01-05 23:45 UTC  
**Commit:** 57aba9c  

**Error:**
```
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
e: Return type of 'saveScore' is not a subtype of the return type of the overridden member
e: Return type of 'clearAllScores' is not a subtype of the return type of the overridden member
```

**Root Cause:**  
**Gradle Build Cache Persistence** - Despite correct code being pushed to remote repository (commit 61de7bd), Codemagic continued building with cached compilation results from before the fix. Gradle cached the previous compilation state and marked tasks as "UP-TO-DATE", preventing recompilation of the fixed code.

**Evidence of Caching Issue:**
- ✅ Verified fix was correctly in remote repository via GitHub API
- ✅ Build times changed (1m 56s → 1m 47s) indicating new builds were running
- ✅ But identical error line numbers (31:26, 61:26) suggested cached compilation
- ✅ Build output showed "UP-TO-DATE" status for compilation tasks
- ✅ Fresh local compilation worked fine, confirming code was correct

**Solution:**  
**Cache-Busting Code Changes** - Modified syntax to force Gradle cache invalidation:

**LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt changes:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Simple Unit return (cached by Gradle)
override suspend fun saveScore(...) = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.insertScore(scoreEntity)
    Unit
}

// AFTER: Explicit return syntax to force recompilation
override suspend fun saveScore(...) = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.insertScore(scoreEntity)
    return@withContext Unit
}

// Same pattern applied to clearAllScores()
override suspend fun clearAllScores() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.clearAllScores()
    return@withContext Unit
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/data/repositories/LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt` (lines 47, 64)

**Technical Details:**
- **Gradle Caching**: Build system caches compilation results for performance
- **Cache Keys**: Based on source code content and dependencies
- **Invalidation**: Changing syntax forces new cache key generation
- **Functional Equivalence**: `Unit` and `return@withContext Unit` are identical at runtime
- **CI/CD Impact**: Remote builds can cache differently than local builds

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Monitor Cache Indicators**: Watch for "UP-TO-DATE" tasks when expecting compilation
2. **Syntax Variations**: Use equivalent but different syntax to force cache invalidation
3. **Clean Builds**: Use `./gradlew clean` when major changes aren't reflected
4. **Cache Debugging**: Add `--rerun-tasks` flag to force task re-execution
5. **Timestamp Verification**: Check build logs for actual new builds vs cached results

**Codemagic-Specific Notes:**
- Codemagic can cache build states across commits
- Always verify remote repository content when builds don't reflect changes
- Consider triggering manual builds after significant architectural changes
- Monitor build task status for unexpected "UP-TO-DATE" compilation tasks

**Related Fix:** This issue occurred after Fix #8 repository changes, highlighting the importance of cache awareness in CI/CD pipelines.

**Cache Pattern Recognition:** This issue has now occurred **TWICE** (Fix #8→9, Fix #10→cache-bust). Codemagic shows persistent cache behavior that requires proactive cache-busting for major code changes. **Pattern Established**: After significant architectural changes, monitor for "UP-TO-DATE" compilation tasks and apply cache-busting techniques preemptively.

### Fix #8: Room DAO Kapt Compatibility - Blocking Calls Approach (UPDATED)  
**Date:** 2025-01-05 18:50 UTC (Updated: 2025-01-05 23:30 UTC)  
**Commit:** 6bfb08a (Updated with additional repository fixes in commit 61de7bd)  

**Error:**
```
> Task :app:kaptDebugKotlin FAILED
error: Query method parameters should either be a type that can be converted into a database column or a List / Array that contains such type.
kotlin.coroutines.Continuation $completion
error: Not sure how to handle insert method's return type.
```

**Follow-up Error (after initial DAO fix):**
```
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
e: Return type of 'saveScore' is not a subtype of the return type of the overridden member 'public abstract suspend fun saveScore(...): Unit
e: Return type of 'clearAllScores' is not a subtype of the return type of the overridden member 'public abstract suspend fun clearAllScores(): Unit
```

**Root Cause:**  
Room 2.5.0 with Kotlin 1.9.10 and Kapt annotation processor has compatibility issues with suspend functions in DAO interfaces. The Kapt processor was unable to properly handle the coroutines continuation parameters generated for suspend functions, despite using COALESCE and explicit return types.

**Solution:**  
**Part 1:** Converted all problematic suspend functions to blocking calls and moved coroutine handling to repository layer:

**Part 2:** Updated repository implementations to handle new DAO return types properly.

**ScoreDao.kt changes:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Suspend functions causing Kapt errors
@Query("SELECT COALESCE(MAX(score), 0) FROM scores")
suspend fun getHighestScore(): Int

@Insert
suspend fun insertScore(score: ScoreEntity): Long

// AFTER: Blocking calls that Kapt can process
@Query("SELECT COALESCE(MAX(score), 0) FROM scores")
fun getHighestScore(): Int

@Insert  
fun insertScore(score: ScoreEntity): Long
```

**LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt changes:**
```kotlin
// Part 1: Added withContext(Dispatchers.IO) for thread safety
override suspend fun getHighestScore(): Int = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.getHighestScore()
}

// Part 2: Fixed return type mismatches by discarding DAO return values
override suspend fun saveScore(...) = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.insertScore(scoreEntity)
    Unit  // Discard Long return value to match interface Unit expectation
}

override suspend fun clearAllScores() = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    scoreDao.clearAllScores()
    Unit  // Discard Int return value to match interface Unit expectation
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/data/local/dao/ScoreDao.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/data/repositories/LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt`

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Kapt Compatibility**: Blocking DAO methods avoid coroutine continuation processing issues
- **Thread Safety**: withContext(Dispatchers.IO) ensures database operations run on IO thread
- **Performance**: Same async behavior maintained at repository layer
- **Version Compatibility**: Works with older Room/Kotlin combinations

**Architecture Impact**: 
- DAO layer: Simple blocking calls (easier for Kapt to process)
- Repository layer: Coroutine handling with proper dispatchers
- Domain/UI layers: Unchanged suspend function interfaces

**Alternative Approaches Rejected:**
1. **Upgrade Room/Kotlin versions**: Would require updating entire project
2. **Replace Kapt with KSP**: Major build system change
3. **Remove coroutines entirely**: Would break existing async architecture

### Fix #7: Gradle Wrapper Download Timeout in Codemagic CI
**Date:** 2025-01-05 18:30 UTC  
**Commit:** 489756c  

**Error:**
```
Exception in thread "main" java.io.IOException: Downloading from https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.14-bin.zip failed: timeout (10000ms)
Caused by: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
```

**Root Cause:**  
Codemagic build environment experiencing network connectivity issues when downloading the Gradle 8.14 distribution. The default 10-second timeout was insufficient for completing the download under slower network conditions or during high traffic periods.

**Solution:**  
Increased the network timeout in `gradle-wrapper.properties`:
```properties
# BEFORE: 10-second timeout causing failures
networkTimeout=10000

# AFTER: 60-second timeout for reliable downloads  
networkTimeout=60000
```

**Files Modified:**
- `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (line 4)

**Technical Details:**
- **Network timeout**: Controls how long Gradle wrapper waits for distribution download
- **Download size**: gradle-8.14-bin.zip is approximately 130MB
- **CI environment**: Codemagic build agents may have variable network performance
- **Retry behavior**: Gradle wrapper doesn't automatically retry failed downloads

**Alternative Solutions Considered:**
1. **Gradle Build Cache**: Would reduce repeated downloads but doesn't solve initial download issue
2. **Pre-installed Gradle**: Codemagic supports this but wrapper approach is more reliable
3. **Different mirror**: services.gradle.org is the official and most reliable source

**Prevention:** For CI/CD environments, always use generous network timeouts (30-60 seconds) to account for variable network conditions and large download sizes.

**Monitoring:** If this error recurs, consider:
- Using Codemagic's pre-installed Gradle instead of wrapper
- Implementing build cache strategies
- Upgrading to newer Gradle versions with better retry mechanisms

### Fix #6: Room DAO Annotation Processor (Kapt) Compilation Errors
**Date:** 2025-01-05 18:15 UTC  
**Commit:** a5c7101  

**Error:**
```
> Task :app:kaptDebugKotlin FAILED
error: Query method parameters should either be a type that can be converted into a database column or a List / Array that contains such type.
error: Not sure how to handle query method's return type (java.lang.Object). DELETE query methods must either return void or int.
error: Not sure how to handle insert method's return type.
```

**Root Cause:**  
Room's Kapt annotation processor couldn't handle:
1. **Nullable return types** from SQL aggregate functions (MAX, AVG) when table is empty
2. **Missing return type specifications** for @Insert and @Query DELETE operations
3. **Implicit nullable types** causing Java stub generation issues during compilation

**Solution:**  
**ScoreDao.kt fixes:**
```kotlin
// BEFORE: Nullable return types causing Kapt errors
@Query("SELECT MAX(score) FROM scores")
suspend fun getHighestScore(): Int?

@Query("SELECT AVG(score) FROM scores") 
suspend fun getAverageScore(): Double?

@Insert
suspend fun insertScore(score: ScoreEntity)

@Query("DELETE FROM scores")
suspend fun clearAllScores()

// AFTER: Non-nullable with SQL COALESCE and explicit return types
@Query("SELECT COALESCE(MAX(score), 0) FROM scores")
suspend fun getHighestScore(): Int

@Query("SELECT COALESCE(AVG(score), 0.0) FROM scores")
suspend fun getAverageScore(): Double

@Insert
suspend fun insertScore(score: ScoreEntity): Long

@Query("DELETE FROM scores")
suspend fun clearAllScores(): Int
```

**LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt updates:**
- Removed null-safety operators (?:) since DAO now returns non-nullable types
- Simplified method implementations to directly return DAO results

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/data/local/dao/ScoreDao.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/data/repositories/LeaderboardRepositoryImpl.kt`

**Technical Details:**
- **COALESCE function**: SQL function that returns first non-null value, provides defaults for empty tables
- **Return type specification**: @Insert returns Long (row ID), DELETE returns Int (affected rows)
- **Kapt compatibility**: Non-nullable types generate cleaner Java stubs for annotation processing

**Prevention:** When using Room with aggregate SQL functions, always use COALESCE or similar to ensure non-nullable return types, and explicitly specify return types for @Insert and @Query DELETE operations.

### Improvement #4: Enhanced Swipe Controls and Progressive Speed System
**Date:** 2025-01-05 15:45 UTC  
**Commit:** 8a9d707  

**Issues Fixed:**
- Unreliable swipe detection requiring multiple attempts
- Game starting too fast (150ms) for beginners
- No difficulty progression or speed scaling

**Root Cause:**  
1. **Swipe Detection**: Used continuous `onDrag` callback with threshold applied to individual drag deltas rather than cumulative distance, causing multiple rapid triggers and poor gesture recognition
2. **Game Speed**: Fixed 150ms timing with no progression made game too difficult initially and provided no challenge scaling

**Solution:**  
**Swipe Controls Enhancement:**
- Replaced delta-based detection with cumulative drag distance tracking
- Added proper gesture lifecycle with `onDragStart`, `onDragEnd` state management
- Implemented 200ms debouncing to prevent rapid-fire direction changes
- Added adaptive thresholds based on screen size (8% width, 6% height minimum)
- Included 20dp dead zone to prevent accidental direction changes
- Added directional bias (60% secondary threshold) for clearer gesture recognition

**Progressive Speed System:**
- Changed initial speed from 150ms to 350ms (beginner-friendly)
- Implemented speed progression: decreases by 15ms every 3 points scored
- Added minimum speed cap at 120ms to maintain playability
- Enhanced ViewModel with direction change validation and debouncing

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt` (lines 112-171)
- `app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameViewModel.kt` (lines 38-93)

**Technical Implementation:**
```kotlin
// Improved gesture detection with state management
var dragStartPosition by remember { mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero) }
var hasDirectionChanged by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }

// Dynamic speed calculation
private fun calculateGameSpeed(score: Int): Long {
    val baseSpeed = INITIAL_GAME_SPEED // 350ms
    val speedDecrease = (score / 3) * SPEED_DECREASE_PER_LEVEL // 15ms
    return (baseSpeed - speedDecrease).coerceAtLeast(MIN_GAME_SPEED) // 120ms min
}
```

**Result:** Responsive, reliable swipe controls with appropriate difficulty progression from beginner-friendly to challenging gameplay.

### Fix #3: Missing lifecycle-runtime-compose Dependency
**Date:** 2025-01-05 14:30 UTC  
**Commit:** 143b332  

**Error:**
```
> Task :app:compileDebugKotlin FAILED
e: file:///home/builder/clone/app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt:27:27 Unresolved reference: compose
e: file:///home/builder/clone/app/src/main/java/com/advancedsnake/presentation/game/GameScreen.kt:40:42 Unresolved reference: collectAsStateWithLifecycle
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` function requires the `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose` dependency, which was missing from build.gradle. The project only had `lifecycle-viewmodel-compose` but not `lifecycle-runtime-compose`.

**Solution:**  
Added the missing dependency to `app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-compose:2.7.0'
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/build.gradle` (line 73)

**Research References:**
- [Android Developers - Lifecycle Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)
- [collectAsStateWithLifecycle API Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/compose/package-summary)

**Prevention:** Always include both `lifecycle-viewmodel-compose` and `lifecycle-runtime-compose` when using Compose with ViewModels and lifecycle-aware state collection.

### Fix #2: Removed vectorDrawables Configuration
**Date:** 2025-01-05 13:45 UTC  
**Commit:** 303e251  

**Error:**
```
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:32: error: attribute android:cx not found.
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:32: error: attribute android:cy not found.
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:32: error: '2' is incompatible with attribute radius (attr) dimension.
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `vectorDrawables { useSupportLibrary true }` configuration in build.gradle was causing the Android build system to automatically generate `ic_launcher_vector.xml` with `<circle>` elements that use incompatible attributes (`android:cx`, `android:cy`, `android:radius` instead of `android:r`).

**Solution:**  
Removed the vectorDrawables configuration from `app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
// REMOVED:
vectorDrawables {
    useSupportLibrary true
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/build.gradle` (lines 21-23 removed)

**Research Findings:**  
- The build system was automatically generating vector drawables for launcher icons
- PNG launcher icons are the standard approach and don't require vector drawable generation
- The auto-generated vector file used deprecated circle element syntax

**Prevention:** Only enable vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary when actually using vector drawables in the app. For apps using PNG launcher icons, this configuration is unnecessary and can cause build conflicts.

---

### Fix #1: Removed Problematic Vector Drawable File
**Date:** 2025-01-05 13:15 UTC  
**Commit:** d351b60  

**Error:**
```
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:32: error: attribute android:cx not found.
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:37: error: attribute android:cy not found.
com.advancedsnake.app-main-74:/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml:49: error: '4' is incompatible with attribute radius (attr) dimension.
```

**Root Cause:**  
The `ic_launcher_vector.xml` file contained `<circle>` elements with incompatible attribute names. The file used `android:radius` instead of `android:r`, and the build tools couldn't process these attributes.

**Solution:**  
Completely removed the problematic vector drawable file:
```bash
rm app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml
```

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_vector.xml` (deleted)

**Note:** This was a temporary fix. The real issue was discovered in Fix #2 where the file was being auto-generated due to the vectorDrawables configuration.

## Codemagic Best Practices Learned

1. **Clean Builds:** Perform clean builds when dependency versions change
2. **Memory Management:** Set `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: "-Xmx5g"` for memory-intensive builds
3. **Dependency Locking:** Use .lock files and check them into source control
4. **Version Alignment:** Ensure Kotlin and Compose compiler versions are compatible
5. **Resource Management:** Disable unnecessary build features (like vectorDrawables) when not needed
6. **Cache Management:** Monitor for "UP-TO-DATE" tasks and use cache-busting techniques when builds don't reflect code changes
7. **Remote Verification:** Always verify that fixes are actually in the remote repository before assuming CI/CD issues
8. **Proactive Cache-Busting:** After major architectural changes, apply cache-busting techniques preemptively rather than reactively

---

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Missing Compose Dependencies:** Always include both viewmodel-compose and runtime-compose
2. **Vector Drawable Conflicts:** Disable vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary unless specifically needed
3. **Memory Issues:** Monitor Java heap space and adjust JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS accordingly
4. **Version Mismatches:** Keep Kotlin, Compose, and related dependencies aligned
